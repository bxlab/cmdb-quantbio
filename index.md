<!--- Recall that a link looks like [Friday](day5/index.html) --->
<!--

      Basic python: running scripts, types up to list, files, reading line-by-line, split and join,
        - Exercise: summarizing SAM file, various questions not needing dictionaries
      Python II: dictionaries, functions, modules (importing) with numpy and statsmodels
        - Introduce another format and parse it, using numpy

      Python III: classes -- FASTA parser
        - Parsing blast output (too hard? we pushed this all the way to day 5 in 2015)

      Python IV: counting k-mers using FASTA parser
        - k-mer matching
