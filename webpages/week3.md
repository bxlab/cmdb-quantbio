## Live-coding

As always, before you do anything else, create a `week3` directory in your `qbb2023-answers` directory for this assignment, and create a `README.md` file in that `week3` directory. This is where you will be putting and uploading all of your code/plots/etc. for this assignment.

We would recommend creating a `livecoding` directory within your `week3` directory, and putting your live-coding scripts there. You can add the `livecoding` directory to your `.gitignore` so that `git` won't track these files.

Wherever you choose to do your live-coding, you can download the following two files:
1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/main/assignments/lab/alignment/livecoding_resources/needleman-wunsch_livecoding_empty.py`
2. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/main/assignments/lab/alignment/livecoding_resources/needleman-wunsch_livecoding_master.py`

The first contains just the prompts for the live-coding exercises. The second file contains the actual code itself, in case you get lost or want to look back at the live-coding during the homework.

## Homework Assignment

Complete the homework assignment in your `week3` submission directory in your `qbb2023-answers`.
