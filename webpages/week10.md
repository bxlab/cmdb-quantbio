## Live-coding

As always, before you do anything else, create a `week10` directory in your `qbb2025-answers` directory for this assignment, and create a `README.md` file in that `week10` directory. This is where you will be putting and uploading all of your code/plots/etc. for this assignment.

I recommend creating a `livecoding` directory within your `week10` directory, and putting your live-coding scripts and data there. You can add the `livecoding` directory to your `.gitignore` so that `git` won't track these files.

Wherever you choose to do your live-coding, you can right-click the following link and select "Save Link As...":

You can also get the filled-in version, but I suggest you wait until after the lecture to download this one:



You can also download the live-coding script we will be writing [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/refs/heads/main/assignments/lab/alignment/livecoding_resources/needleman-wunsch_livecoding_master.ipynb) so you can follow along or catch up if you fall behind.

## Homework Assignment

Complete the homework assignment in your `week10` submission directory in your `qbb2025-answers`.
