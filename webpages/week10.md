## Live-coding

As always, before you do anything else, create a `week10` directory in your `qbb2024-answers` directory for this assignment, and create a `README.md` file in that `week10` directory. This is where you will be putting and uploading all of your code/plots/etc. for this assignment.

I recommend creating a `livecoding` directory within your `week10` directory, and putting your live-coding scripts and data there. You can add the `livecoding` directory to your `.gitignore` so that `git` won't track these files.

Before starting, you will need to install an addiitonal python package using the following command:

```bash
conda install plotly -y
```

Wherever you choose to do your live-coding, you can download the following file:
[live_coding_images.tar.gz](https://github.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/raw/refs/heads/main/assignments/lab/image_processing/extra_data/live_coding_images.tar.gz)

This file contains the data you'll need for the live-coding exercises. Once downloaded, unzip it with the following command:

```
tar -xvzf live_coding_images.tar.gz
```

You can also download the live-coding script we will be writing [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/refs/heads/main/assignments/lab/image_processing/slides_asynchronous_or_livecoding_resources/live_coding.py) so you can follow along or catch up if you fall behind. This also has two functions you will use in your homework assignment.

Since today deviated a bit from the live-coding template, I am also uploading the actual live code from class [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/refs/heads/main/assignments/lab/image_processing/slides_asynchronous_or_livecoding_resources/inclass_live_coding.py).

## Homework Assignment

Complete the homework assignment in your `week10` submission directory in your `qbb2024-answers`.
