## Live-coding

Before you copy the live-coding scripts into your homework directory, navigate to `~/cmdb-quantbio/` and do a `git pull`. After that's finished, you can copy the scripts into your homework directory. Do NOT edit the files in `~/cmdb-quantbio/`. Copy them into `qbb2022-answers/day2-homework/` and work with the copies.

## Applied Paper Example

[Check out this paper by GPP student Katherine Huffer where they compare TRP channel proteins through structure-based and sequence-based alignment methods](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32804077/)

Feel free to read as much of it as you want, but we'd like you to at least read the intro and first paragraph of the results, as well as look at Figure 2 figure supplements 1 and 4.
