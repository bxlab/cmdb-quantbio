## Live-coding

As always, before you do anything else, create a `week5` directory in your `qbb2024-answers` directory for this assignment, and create a `README.md` file in that `week5` directory. This is where you will be putting and uploading all of your code/plots/etc. for this assignment.

We would recommend creating a `livecoding` directory within your `week5` directory, and putting your live-coding scripts and data there. You can add the `livecoding` directory to your `.gitignore` so that `git` won't track these files.

Wherever you choose to do your live-coding, you can download the following file:
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/refs/heads/main/assignments/lab/bulk_RNA-seq_part1/extra_data/bulkRnaSeqData.tar.gz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bxlab/cmdb-quantbio/refs/heads/main/assignments/lab/bulk_RNA-seq_part1/extra_data/bulkRnaSeqData.tar.gz)

This file contains the data you'll need for the live-coding exercises. Once downloaded, unzip it with the following command:

```
tar -xvzf bulkRnaSeqData.tar.gz
```

## Homework Assignment

Complete the homework assignment in your `week5` submission directory in your `qbb2024-answers`.
