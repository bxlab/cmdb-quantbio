## Live-coding

As always, before you do anything else, create a `week5` directory in your `qbb2023-answers` directory for this assignment, and create a `README.md` file in that `week5` directory. This is where you will be putting and uploading all of your code/plots/etc. for this assignment.

We would recommend creating a `livecoding` directory within your `week5` directory, and putting your live-coding scripts there. You can add the `livecoding` directory to your `.gitignore` so that `git` won't track these files.

Wherever you choose to do your live-coding, you can download the following file:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ye4h2eemcvsomsaccag4h/live_coding_data.tar.gz?rlkey=lgwmjno4ojojxbdwzj4fjamai&dl=0

This file contains the data you'll need for the live-coding exercises. Once downloaded, unzip it with the following command:

```
tar -xvzf live_coding_data.tar.gz
```
