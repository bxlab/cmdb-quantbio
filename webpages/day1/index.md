## Program Documentation, Online Resources, and Debugging

Computational Learning Objectives
- Practice and expand knowledge of bash command line tools (e.g., cut, grep, uniq, awk) for processing text files
- Introduce programs that can be installed and run from command line (e.g., bedtools) for processing and comparing files
- Further overview and discuss the use of bed and vcf files for storing biological data
- Practice reading manuals and documentation for tools/programs, especially awk and bedtools.
- Practice using Google, StackOverflow, Biostars, StackExchange, GeeksForGeeks for writing and debugging code

Biological and Bioinformatic Analysis Learning Objectives
- Experience the importance of keeping a lab notebook and recording what you did and why
- Understand ways we relate biological data to each other by localizing data to regions in the genome
- Explore annotations of the genome and what they communicate about different genomic regions
