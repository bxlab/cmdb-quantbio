# Software Carpentry: Python Novice

- https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/instructor

## Summary and Setup

1. 

## Motivation (1:00-1:10; PowerPoint)

- What is a program?
- Why Python?

## Executing code (1:10-1:40; live coding)

1. Interactively via the interpreter (1:10-1:25)
- demonstrate use as a calculator
- demonstrate a print statement "Hello, World!"
- demonstrate statements that would produce an error
- demonstrate what happens if you press enter before completing a statment

Give students time to experiment on their own and emphasize the power of experimenting!

2. As scripts via the command line (1:25-1:40)
- demonstrate conversion of "Hello, World!" to a script
- what happens if I don't have a print statement?
- demonstrate a script that would produce an error

Allow students to practice and experiment

## Basic data types (1:40-2:10; live coding)

1. Numbers (int, float, complex) (1:40-1:50)
- describe how to specify and convert among types
- demonstrate what happens when you perform operations on mixed types

2. Booleans (and comparison operators) (1:50-1:55)
- show that booleans are specified without quotes
- demonstrate how comparisons produce Booleans

3. Strings (don't introduce this as a sequence/interable yet) (1:55-2:00)
- show that strings are specified with quotes
- show some basic operations that are possible with strings (e.g., `+`)
- show what happens when you try to add a string and a number
- show conversion of a string to a number
- show some string methods, such as `.toupper()` as an intro to the concept of methods

Allow students to practice specifying, converting, and checking types (2:00-2:10)

## Variables (2:10 - 2:25; live coding)

1. Creating variables
- use SWCarpentry example for creating variables (`weight_kg = 65`) https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/instructor/01-intro.html#variables
- demonstrate that you can check the type of a variable
- demonstrate that you can perform operations on variables
- show that simply performing the operation does not change the variable
- demonstrate that you can copy the value of one variable to a new variable, but these are subsequently unrelated

2. Changing variables
- use SWCarpentry example of how to create new variables via operations on existing variables (`weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg`)
- show that does not alter the original variable
- show how you can update the value of a variable

## Lists (2:25 - 2:55; live coding)

Work through SWCarpentry materials: https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/instructor/04-lists.html

1. Creating lists (2:25-2:30)

2. Indexing lists (2:30-2:40)
- basic integer indexing (zero-based)
- negative integers as indices
- slicing

3. Modifying lists (2:40-2:50)
- changing specific elements based on indexing
- list methods such as `.append()`, `.pop()`, and `.reverse()` - use this to reinforce the concept of methods
- combining lists

4. Nested lists (2:50-2:55)
- lists can even contain lists as elements
- how to index a nested list

## `for` loops (2:55 - 3:15; live coding)
