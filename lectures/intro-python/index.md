# Software Carpentry: Python Novice

- https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/instructor

## Summary and Setup

1. 

## Motivation (1:00-1:10; PowerPoint)

- What is a program?
- Why Python?

## Executing code (1:10-1:40; live coding)

1. Interactively via the interpreter (1:10-1:25)
- demonstrate use as a calculator
- demonstrate a print statement "Hello, World!"
- demonstrate statements that would produce an error
- demonstrate what happens if you press enter before completing a statment
- give students some time to experiment on their own and emphasize the power of experimenting!

2. As scripts via the command line (1:25-1:40)
- demonstrate conversion of "Hello, World!" to a script
- what happens if I don't have a print statement?
- demonstrate a script that would produce an error
- allow students to practice and experiment

## Basic data types (1:40-2:10; live coding)

1. Numbers (int, float, complex) (1:40-1:50)
- describe how to specify and convert among types
- demonstrate what happens when you perform operations on mixed types

2. Booleans (and comparison operators) (1:50-1:55)
- show that booleans are specified without quotes
- demonstrate how comparisons produce Booleans

3. Strings (don't introduce this as a sequence/interable yet) (1:55-2:00)
- show that strings are specified with quotes
- show some basic operations that are possible with strings (e.g., `+`)
- show what happens when you try to add a string and a number
- show conversion of a string to a number

Allow students to practice specifying, converting, and checking types (2:00-2:10)
