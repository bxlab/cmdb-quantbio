<a name="Description"></a>
### Course Description
Quantitative and computational methods are increasingly essential to all sub-disciplines of modern biological research. The goal of this intensive week-long “boot camp” is to empower students with the fundamental skills to apply these methods, as well as connect them to resources for further developing their knowledge and abilities. The class starts at 10 am with formal instruction ending at 5 pm daily. The course demonstrates the importance of version control, documentation, testing, and other methods for enhancing reproducibility, reliability, and useability of software. This is achieved through live coding sessions and use of learning exercises, where for the majority of the class, students perform data analysis to address biological questions and reinforce core bioinformatic concepts. Upon completing the course, students should be comfortable using and writing software to work with large-scale biological data. The motivation of this goal is to **develop computational and statistical competence** in preparation for courses, rotations, thesis research, and careers. Rather than blindly outsourcing bioinformatic components of their work, **students will be empowered** to understand methodological details and their associated advantages and limitations. This will in turn advance the broader goal of rigor in experimental design, promoting robust and unbiased results.

<a name="Objectives"></a>
### Specific Objectives
  * Develop **comfort** working within a UNIX environment and at the command line to build and run programs
  * Develop **confidence** using Python and its extended ecosystem of tools for bioinformatic data analysis and visualization
  * Develop **knowledge** of standard bioinformatic file formats and where they fit within the context of a project
  * Develop **appreciation** for and **practice** of concise and transparent presentation of data
  * Develop **fluency** in basic statistical tests, associated assumptions, and interpretation of their output
  * Develop **good habits for ensuring reproducible research**

<a name="StudyMats"></a>
### Study Materials
This course does not have a required text. Any lecture notes or slides will be made available on the course website. Asynchronous videos lectures will likely be posted to YouTube and linked on the course website. Recordings of interactive lectures will be posted to a private OneDrive to which only students, instructors, and TAs will be granted access.

<a name="Format"></a>
## Course Format

<a name="Attendance"></a>
### Attendance
Due to the interactive nature of this course, there is a policy that students **should not participate in any other meetings, courses, or lab work throughout the week**. We recognize that this year is unique in that elective courses may begin concurrent with bootcamp. However, as a core CMDB course, bootcamp should take priority. If a student foresees attendance conflicts among their courses, they should contact a TA immediately so that this policy can be communicated to the necessary parties.<br /><br />

Please be on time for course activities, and budget extra time in anticipation of technical delays. Your attendance is expected during all synchronous sessions and your effort is also expected during asynchronous sessions. Exceptions have been specifically granted for students in distant time zones. Please let us know about any emergencies, family responsibilities, illness, etc. that may prevent attendance, and we will work to accommodate reasonable requests.

<a name="Sessions"></a>
### Types of Sessions
The course is broke into four main **types of sessions**

<a name="FormatAsynch"></a>
1. <ins>Asynchronous **Video** Lecture Sessions</ins>
    * These sessions consist of short, pre-recorded videos that introduce the lecture topic and relevant background information. The videos will be posted to YouTube (or a similar platform) and linked on the course website.
    * Students are responsible for watching and taking notes on these sessions, as they will not be hosted on Zoom.
    * Students will have the opportunity to ask questions about the videos through, Slack or once the class reconvenes on Zoom for the following Interactive Session.
<a name="FormatInter"></a>
2. <ins>**Interactive** Lecture & **Live-Coding** Sessions</ins>
    * These sessions will be held through Zoom and consist of interactive lectures and instructor-guided live-coding examples, which introduce and expand on material for the exercise sessions that occur directly afterward.
    * Students should mute themselves while instructors are presenting unless involved in discussion or debugging.
    * We ask that students join breakout rooms when asked and to use video in the breakout room if possible.
    * The instructor will pause periodically to invite questions, let students catch up, and solicit Slack check-ins. See the next syllabus section, [Asking for help](#Help), on more specific information pertaining to questions and debugging in these sessions.
    * These sessions will be recorded and posted to the private course OneDrive.
<a name="FormatExercise"></a>
3. <ins>**Exercise** Sessions (Lunch and Homework)</ins>
    * These sessions will be held through three Zoom meetings, each hosted by a TA. Students are randomly split into pairs and assigned to one of the three meetings. In the meeting, pairs are sent to breakout rooms where they work together on the exercises.
    * We encourage students to turn on their video if possible and utilize screen sharing to debug or discuss with their partners.
    * While partners are expected to have very similar answers, students should put in individualized effort and strive to understand every line of code and analysis step they take. See the [Academic Integrity & Ethics](#Integrity) syllabus section for more information.
    * Course-wide announcements and updates during these sessions will be posted to Slack.
    * See the next syllabus section, [Asking for help](#Help), on more specific information pertaining to questions and debugging in these sessions.
    * These sessions will not be recorded.
<a name="FormatPres"></a>
4. <ins>Student **Presentation** Sessions</ins>
    * These sessions will be hosted through Zoom. Pairs of students will informally present their code and results from the most recent exercise.
    * Instructors will provide feedback, and invite questions and discussion among the whole class on alternative approaches and solutions.
    * Students should mute themselves unless presenting or participating in the discussion. We also ask that students turn on their video if possible to create a more welcoming environment for the students presenting.
    * These sessions will be recorded and posted to the private OneDrive.
    * Presentations are **ungraded**
    * Typically, these sessions precede the asynchronous video sessions.

<a name="DaySchedule"></a>
### Daily Schedule
Some mornings or afternoons may be fully interactive, with no asynchronous sessions. We will let you know this in advance through Slack. However, the **daily schedule** will generally be:

<a name="Reflections"></a>
### Daily Reflections
We ask students to write **daily reflections** and email these to a TA by **6pm ET**. Since they will be turned in before completion of the day’s homework assignment, reflections should focus on the previous day’s homework and the current day’s lessons and lunch exercise. The purpose of reflections is threefold.
1. First, because we can’t meet in person to discuss progress and struggles, we will use the reflections to better ascertain a student’s progress over the week.
2. Second, we believe this exercise has the potential to grow a student’s understanding and confidence as they purposefully reflect and see their improvement.
3. Third, this practice directly cultivates good habits in reproducible analysis and keeping a lab notebook.

We expect these reflections to be short, but **respond to each of the following prompts**:
  * What purpose did today’s lessons, my analysis, and my coding serve?
  * How might I use what I did and learned today in the future?
  * What was my greatest struggle?
  * What was my greatest achievement?
  * What one lingering question, bemusing, or idea (on theory, syntax, etc.) do I find most perplexing or exciting?

Notes on reflections:
  * As long as reflections attempt to respond to the above prompts, the content of the reflection will not affect a student’s grade in any way. See the [Grading](#Grading) section for further clarification.
  * We aim to keep reflections confidential. As such, only instructors, TAs, and the student will have access to a student’s reflections.

<a name="Help"></a><a name="DOIT"></a>
## Asking for Help
We both expect and encourage you to ask questions and request help throughout this course. Everyone is learning and there is no shame in having questions, not understanding what an instructor has said or typed, or needing to debug your code. Therefore, **please ask questions** about whatever and whenever you need to. We’ve written up guidelines below on how you can ask for help during each type of session.

<a name="HelpAsynch"></a>
### Asynchronous Video Sessions
At the beginning of **asynchronous video sessions**, a TA will post a poll in #bootcamp_2020 for tracking your completion of the session. React to this message with a **:yellow_sticky:** once the poll is posted. After you finish the video, change your react to a **:green_sticky:**. Make notes of any questions you have while watching the video. When everyone has joined the Zoom call for the next session, the Lead Instructor will ask for questions regarding the video content. You can then use the “raise hand” feature in Zoom to ask questions, and the Lead Instructor will answer them directly.

<a name="HelpInter"></a>
### Interactive/ Live-Coding Sessions
During **interactive/ live-coding sessions**, one TA will be designated the Triage TA and is responsible for making sure questions are answered. The Lead Instructor for the session will announce the Triage TA at the beginning of the session, since it is a rotating role.
  * Throughout the session, **keep the `#questions_2020` Slack channel open**.
    * If your question has already been posted by someone else and not answered in a verbal or thread response, please add a **:pink_sticky:** react to that post.
    * Perhaps your question is related to one that has already been posted. In that case, reply to the original post in a thread and add your question there. Alternatively, you can DM the Triage TA with your question and reference which post it is similar to.
    * If your question or a similar one has not been posted yet, please make a new post in `#questions_2020`. If you are not comfortable posting your question, you can DM the Triage TA, who will anonymously post it in the channel for you.
    * Note that we assume a question is “closed” once it has been answered. However, you may still be confused. In that case, please reply to the thread (and @ the Triage TA), or DM the Triage TA.
  * For most live-coding sessions, the Lead Instructor will solicit **Check Ins** every 10-15 minutes, asking students to respond to a poll in **`#bootcamp_2020`** about whether they are ready to move on to the next section.
    * **:green_sticky:** react if you’re following along and are ready to move on.
    * **:yellow_sticky:** react if you’re catching up/not ready to move on, but do not need assistance. Change to a :green_sticky: or :pink_sticky: as needed.
    * **:pink_sticky:** react if you need assistance. The Triage TA will pair an instructor or TA with you and send you to a breakout room to be helped. Once you’re ready to move on, change your react to a :green_sticky:.
    *  Once only ~2-4 students need assistance, the Triage TA will announce in Slack that we will be moving on. At this point, if you are in a breakout room, you should feel welcome to rejoin the main session and continue your discussion with the TA/instructor over Slack, or you can remain in the breakout room. If your instructor or TA thinks that your troubleshooting requires it, they will ask that the class continues to pause.
  * If the Lead Instructor prompts the class to ask questions verbally, use the “raise hand” feature in Zoom and unmute to talk.

<a name="HelpExercise"></a>
### Lunch/ Homework Exercises
During **Lunch** or **Homework Exercises**, students will be paired and sent into breakout rooms within one of three Zoom meetings, each run by a different TA. **Please be patient** with your TA, as each of them has approximately 10 students to help and the instructors will not always be available to assist.
  * TAs will hop through breakout rooms every ~15-30 minutes to check on students’ progress and ask if they need help. TAs will let the groups know when they begin and end this hopping. Otherwise, the TA will be in the main meeting room. Screen sharing will be the primary means for TAs to review and debug students’ work.
  * When a TA is not breakout room surfing, students may leave their breakout room to ask the TA questions in the main room. Note that several pairs may be in the main meeting room at the same time. Screen sharing will be the primary means for TAs to review and debug students’ work. Once their question is answered, students will be returned to their breakout room by the TA.
  * Students may also remain in their breakout rooms and Slack questions to their TA. The TA will respond when back in the main meeting room, and will attempt to utilize a queue system such that they answer questions based on when the question was asked. In this case, screenshots or markdown formatted code will be the primary means for TAs to review and debug students’ work. TAs may also ask the students to join them in the main room if the TA feels that screen sharing would be better for debugging.
  * Finally, TAs (from all three Zoom meetings) will post relevant/common questions, observations, and hints in the `#questions_2020` channel at their discretion. Students should feel free to interact with any of these posts.

<a name="HelpPres"></a>
### Presentations
During **Presentations**, **please wait to ask questions until the presenting student(s) have finished**. You may slack any TA during the presentation, but it is likely in your best interest to wait until questions or comments are solicited by the Lead Instructor.

<a name="Googling"></a>
### Googling
**Googling** is always an acceptable way to find answers or help, and we encourage you to utilize it extensively. A Tuesday lesson will give you some useful tips on Googling error messages. If you adopt a solution following a Google search, make sure you understand what you incorporate, rather than just copy/pasting without comprehension of the logic or code. Please see the [Academic Integrity & Ethics](#Integrity) syllabus section for more on this.

<a name="Grading"></a>
## Grading
The grading for this course is based on **reasonable completion**. For each lunch and homework exercise session, students will be advised which exercises are required and which are advanced or optional. Additionally, students will be asked to upload certain Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and results (outputs or plots, etc.) to their personal Github repositories, qbb2020-answers. For lunch exercises, these materials should be pushed to the repository by the end of the lunch exercise session. For homework exercises, these materials should be pushed to the repository by the beginning of the next morning session.<br /><br />

TAs will verify that the student’s submitted work shows a reasonable level of individual effort. Finally, students will have one week post-bootcamp to submit any leftover materials. Letter grades will be assigned in line with the level of completion. While student presentations and the content of daily reflections will not affect grades in any way, failure to turn in daily reflections has the potential to lower the final grade.<br /><br />

General guidelines for letter grade assignments:
  * A (excellent): 90-100% completion
  * B (passing): 80-90% completion
  * C or lower (not passing): <80% completion

<a name="Integrity"></a>
## Academic Integrity & Ethics
Academic and scientific institutions and research depend on honesty and integrity. You should be completing your lunch and homework exercises and your work should not plagiarize others -- including group partners, presenters, and strangers posting to online forums or blogs. You and your partner should be working together, but both persons should be writing and turning in unique, individualized code. Note your scripts and analysis may follow the same logic steps and even have tidbits of the same code, but no one person should be writing the solution the whole group uses character for character. Additionally, you should understand every line of code you write, are given and use, or find online and incorporate. If asked to, you should be able to explain exactly what your code is doing. Another aspect is properly acknowledging the source of  borrowed code. Understanding can be cultivated and acknowledgement implemented by writing both inline and multiline comments (which is a terrific practice in general). Relatedly, don’t give someone code to copy and paste. Make sure any recipient can explain back to you any gifted code. See the university’s guidelines on plagiarism for details and contact a TA with any questions.

<a name="CodeofConduct"></a>
## Code of Conduct
We are committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. This code of conduct applies to all course participants, including instructors and TAs, and to all modes of interaction, including Zoom meetings, Slack messages, and emails.<br /><br />

All class participants agree to:
  * **Be considerate and polite**. Bootcamp is a stressful and sometimes frustrating week for everyone. In addition, the collaborative nature of this course means it is essential that students are respectful of each other’s questions and points of confusion. Remember that you all are coming into this program with a wide range of coding backgrounds. A community where people feel uncomfortable is not conducive for learning.
  * **Work together cooperatively**. Be kind when giving feedback on your classmates’ code, and make an effort to help if they are stuck. You will gain much more from explaining concepts to someone else than you will from rushing through the assignments on your own.
  * **Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech**. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert one of the instructors or TAs.
  * **Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, negative behavior**. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert an instructor or TA if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, no matter how inconsequential it seems.

<a name="Pandemic"></a>
## The Pandemic
We know that this is one of the least ideal situations in which to be starting your first year of grad school and taking an intensive week-long coding course. Our plan is to be as understanding as possible about grading, attendance, and any issues that come up. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to an instructor or TA if you are having issues, and we will do our best to accomodate you however we can.

<a name="Technology"></a>
## Technology

<a name="Platforms"></a>
### Platforms
Several **platforms** will be utilized for communication and distribution of information. These include Github, MARCC, Slack, Zoom, Poll Everywhere, and OneDrive. Instructions and walkthroughs were previously provided for students to sign up for accounts through Github, MARCC, Slack, and Zoom. If for any reason you do not have one of these accounts, please contact a TA.

<a name="Laptops"></a>
### Laptops
We provide **laptops** with pre-configured software and data. Students must sign a Macbook Pro Agreement Form before shipping or upon pickup of the laptop. Note these laptops are to be returned to the Biology office by 5/31/21 (as per the agreement form). Software issues should be communicated to TAs promptly. In contrast, report any hardware issues to the Biology office.

<a name="Zoom"></a>
### Zoom
**Zoom** will be the primary means by which we meet in this course. Below are the links for each presentation and lecture session. These will also be available on the course website. All Zoom meetings, regardless of session, share the same passcode; however, for security purposes, the links do not have the passcode embedded. The passcode will be posted and pinned in the #bootcamp_2020 Slack channel.<br /><br />

Students will be assigned to one of three Zoom meetings for lunch and homework exercise sessions. The links to these meetings, and the students assigned to each, will be posted on the course website daily. Again, the links will not contain the passcode.<br /><br />

<a name="WindowManagement"></a>
## Window Management
Due to the online nature of this course, you will often have to simultaneously **manage several windows**, and likely also several internet browser tabs, on one 13” laptop screen. Below, we’ve included suggested window configurations for the various types of sessions. These are not required, but we’ve provided recommendations so that you don’t have to spend time figuring them out.<br /><br />
