Q1 - did they use the read_delim function to successfully load data?

Q2 - did they correctly use the glimpse function to look at the data?

Q3 - did they subset the data to (SMGEBTCHT == "TruSeq.v1")?

Q4 - is the correct ggplot code there? okay if they saved the plot as a PDF or PNG, but not necessary

Q5 - Did they make a histogram or density plot or some other reasonable way of displaying the distribution of a single continous variable? Again, code is required, but okay if they also uploaded a plot. Did they include a comment describing the shape of the distribution?

Q6 - Did they use a boxplot, ridgeplot, or some other way of displaying the distribution of a single continuous variable stratified on some factor variable? Did they include a comment describing the differences across tissues, which tissues are outliers, and some hypothesis to explain these observations?

Q7 - Did they use a boxplot, ridgeplot, or some other way of displaying the distribution of a single continuous variable stratified on some factor variable? Did they include a comment describing the differences across tissues, which tissues are outliers, and some hypothesis to explain these observations?

Q8 - Did they use a scatter plot, stratified by tissue with facet_wrap()? Did they resize and change the opacity of points as instructed? Did they add a linear trend lines?

Q9 - Did they color points (but not trend lines) by autolysis score? Did they include a comment describing the relationships and dependence on tissue?

Q10 - <optional>
