    "The GTEx gene expression dataset consists of samples taken from many human subjects across a variety of tissues. From this dataset we have identified a set of highly-expressed tissue-specific genes. In this exercise, you will be pulling the expressing data for those genes but only in their primary tissue of expression and investigating how much variability exists across the sample population.\n",
