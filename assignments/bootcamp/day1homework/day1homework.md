# Day 1 Homework: Python - Lists and For Loops 

For this assignment, we will be working with `inflammation-01.csv`, a simulated dataset representing the response of arthritis patients to a new drug. The data can be downloaded from here: https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/abortvi2_jh_edu/EcnrKIjANkRLkw7WDL-IGiYBtv-BV5VSxzRID-aSfXN2mQ?e=PA3SbQ. The data is sourced from [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/instructor/). 

In this dataset, each row represents a different patient. Each column represents a different day. Each element in the dataset is the number of arthritis flare-ups that a patient has in a given day. 

For each exercise, please submit your code along with your answer. You can have one script per exercise, or have all exercises together in one larger script â€“ either way is fine. Since we haven't yet learned how to write to a file in Python, it is ok to print out your answers and then manually copy them over to a text file.

### Exercise 1: Reading in Data

Print the number of flare-ups that the fifth patient had on the first, tenth, and last day. 

### Exercise 2: Caluclating Averages

For each patient, calculate the average number of flare-ups per day. Print the average values for the first 10 patients. 

These are the row averages - for example, patient 1 has 5.45 flare-ups per day on average; patient 2 has 5.425 flare-ups per day on average. 

### Exercise 3: Finding Maximum and Minimum Values

Using the average flare-ups per day calculated in part 2, print the highest and lowest average number of flare-ups per day. 

### Exercise 4: Differences Between Patients

For each day, print the difference in number of flare-ups between patients 1 and 5. 

### Optional Exercise:

For each day, find the average number of flare-ups across all patients (i.e. the column averages). What is the highest average number of flare-ups per day? 

### Grading: 

* Exercise 1: 
    - 1 pt. Printed out first and last days
* Exercise 2: 
    - 1 pt. Calculate averages for all patients
    - 1 pt. Printed out first 10 averages
* Exercise 3:
    - 1 pt. Printed out maximum
    - 1 pt. Printed out minimum
* Exercise 4: 
    - 1 pt. Printed out differences between patients
