# R has many built-in operators (similar to Python)
1 + 1
10 ^ 3      # exponents
5 %/% 2     # integer (floor) division

# comparison
1 == 1
1 != 2      # not equal to
1 >= -9     # greater than or equal to

# assignment: R commonly uses <- (arrow), though = also works in many contexts
x <- 1/40
x
x <- x + 1  # notice the variable gets updated in the Environment tab

# R is vectorized: many operations work elementwise on vectors
1:5                 # create a vector of the numbers 1 through 5
2^(1:5)
x <- 1:5
2^x

# vectors are a basic data structure; all elements share the same type
# create with c()
c(10, 4, 2, 45.5)
c(10, 4, 2, TRUE)     # coerces to numeric (TRUE -> 1)
c(10, 4, 2, "hello")  # coerces to character

# common atomic types in R: double, logical, integer, character, complex
typeof(2)
typeof(2.1)
typeof("hello, world")
# typeof(True)   # error; R uses TRUE/FALSE (all caps)
typeof(TRUE)
typeof("TRUE")
typeof(2L)       # L denotes integer
typeof(1 + 4i)   # complex

# lists can store heterogeneous types
my_list <- list(10, "hello", c(1, 2, 3), TRUE)

# data frames: columns can have different types (each column itself is a vector)

## 10â€“20 min: load tabular data into a tibble with read_delim()

# Note: if a column that should be numeric loads as character (e.g., due to an NA), use `read_delim(..., na = c("", "NA"))`

## 10 min: select() and filter() from dplyr

# %>% is the pipe character
# R also now has a built-in pipe operator, |>, but we will use %>% as it is the original from the tidyverse

# Arrange descending

# note that the tibble output by the above code is still grouped by species
# to remove all grouping from the output (e.g., if you want to use it in a subsequent step),
# you can use the .groups = "drop" argument


# example: proportion of samples for which body mass measurements are missing by species
penguins %>%
