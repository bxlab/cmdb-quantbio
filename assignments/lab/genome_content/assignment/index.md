## Overview

Learning Objectives
- Explore [genome features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome) such as genes, chromatin, and variants
- Analyze data using [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu) and [BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io)
- Practice running programs in Unix and plotting data in R

## Instructions

Document your answers in `~/qbXX-answers/weekX`

`git push` after each exercise and **do not wait** until the end of the lab

## Exercises

1. Plot gene density across each chromosome

1. Compare hg19 gene annotations with hg16

1. Explore chromatin states between conditions

1. Identify where variation occurs

## Grading

- Plot gene density -- 3 pt
